Byt3Bl33d3r, the creator of MITMf announced the following:
This project is no longer being updated. MITMf was written to address the need, at the time, of a modern tool for performing Man-In-The-Middle attacks. Since then many other tools have been created to fill this space, you should probably be using Bettercap as it is far more feature complete and better maintained.

# easy-mitmf
Install MITMf with a single bash script.


Bash script made with Kali in mind.



How to use?

$ git clone https://github.com/PentestPinguin/easy-mitmf.git

$ cd easy-mitmf

$ chmod +x easy-mitmf.sh

MITMf and everything you need for it to work will now be installed automatically.
